Howdy Y'all! I'm @kordless on YouTube and I occasionally play and stream Rust, the game.

This repo is for deploying a Rust Server running on Google Container Engine. Google has a deal going where you can get $300 of free credits for a year on Google Cloud, so it's a good excuse to signup and run your own server.

This deployment method can be used to start a small server to play with friends or practice building things. In a few days, I'll update the scripts to include a way to save the content you've created, in-game, with others who can then run their own servers and load your content in to explore it for themselves.

For now, start by navigating to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and signup for an account. You'll need to enter some credit card details to get this going, but Google is giving you $300 in credits for the next year. Should be enough to make this FREE if you don't run the server all the time and have people connecting to it!

If you ever need to navigate back to Google Cloud, you'll use the following URL:
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?
```

Once you have finished signing up, you'll need to go and enable [Google Container Engine APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) for your account. 

Watch the [video for more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfDZJDXfhFQ&feature=youtu.be) on how to use the scripts. The basics start once you get into the console.

You can check out this Gist to the Google console by doing the following:

```
git clone
